# Pomodoro Timer

A focused, clean, and slightly neon-styled Pomodoro timer — built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


This timer lets you switch between **Pomodoro**, **Short Break**, and **Long Break** modes with just one click.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple yet good-looking Pomodoro app to practice working with:
- DOM manipulation
- Intervals and timer logic
- Audio playback
- Button interactions and hover effects
